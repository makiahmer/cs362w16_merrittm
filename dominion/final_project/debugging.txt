==== DESCRIPTION ====
Card effect did not perform desired/expected action on the dominion code.

==== CAUSE ====
As part of my bugs for Assignment 1 I deleted a line of code from the adventurer card effect 
responsible for drawing a card.

==== IMPACT ====
Because the function never drew a card the function would repeat the same action over and 
over again.

==== DEBUGGING PROCESS ====
I found this bug while building my adventurer card test for assignment three. Because I knew 
something was wrong when I kept getting the same return from the adventurer card effect I 
decided to walk through the process using Visual Studio's debugger (Visual Studio being my 
primary IDE). As might be expected I threw a breakpoint at the start of the card effects 
process and walked through a few times before finding my issue.

In correspondence with Agans' rules (based off of lesson 19):
	Rule #1:	At this point in development I was fairly accomodated with the dominion code
				to know that the issue was arrising when the card effect function was called
				as such I didn't need to walk through everything else incorporated with 
				playing the card; although I did for good measure.
	
	Rule #2:	This rule applies in the context that I knew the process was failing. Even
				though I didn't explicitly "Make It Fail."
	
	Rule #3:	This rule didn't really apply as I knew the issue was somewhere in the card
				effect process, knowing this I went directly to walking through the process.
	
	Rule #4:	This rule didn't apply.
	
	Rule #5:	This rule didn't apply as I was able to easily identify the issue after a 
				couple walk throughs. There was a lightbulb that went off as if to say 
				"Hey! We're supposed to be drawing a card at this portion of the code. But
				where are we initiating a draw?"
	
	Rule #6:	This rule didn't really apply as the process wasn't that involved. As 
				explained in #5 the process of finding the issue didn't take long. However, 
				I should've made a note while doing my assignment 1 edits in case I happened 
				across the bug, which I did.
	
	Rule #7:	This rule didn't apply.
	
	Rule #8:	This rule didn't apply.
	
	Rule #9:	This rule didn't apply as I needed to fix the bug in order for my adventurer 
				test to run.
